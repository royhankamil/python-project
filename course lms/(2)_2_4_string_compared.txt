Key takeaways

1. Strings can be compared to strings using general comparison operators, but comparing them to numbers gives no reasonable result, because no string can be equal to any number. For example:

string == number is always False;
string != number is always True;
string >= number always raises an exception.

2. Sorting lists of strings can be done by:

a function named sorted(), creating a new, sorted list;
a method named sort(), which sorts the list in situ

3. A number can be converted to a string using the str() function.

4. A string can be converted to a number (although not every string) using either the int() or float() function. The conversion fails if a string doesn't contain a valid number image (an exception is raised then).
