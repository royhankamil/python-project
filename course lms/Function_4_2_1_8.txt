Key takeaways
1. You can pass information to functions by using parameters. Your functions can have as many parameters as you need.

An example of a one-parameter function:

def hi(name):
    print("Hi,", name)

hi("Greg")


An example of a two-parameter function:

def hi_all(name_1, name_2):
    print("Hi,", name_2)
    print("Hi,", name_1)

hi_all("Sebastian", "Konrad")


An example of a three-parameter function:

def address(street, city, postal_code):
    print("Your address is:", street, "St.,", city, postal_code)

s = input("Street: ")
p_c = input("Postal Code: ")
c = input("City: ")

address(s, c, p_c)


2. You can pass arguments to a function using the following techniques:

positional argument passing in which the order of arguments passed matters (Ex. 1),
keyword (named) argument passing in which the order of arguments passed doesn't matter (Ex. 2),
a mix of positional and keyword argument passing (Ex. 3).
Ex. 1
def subtra(a, b):
    print(a - b)

subtra(5, 2)    # outputs: 3
subtra(2, 5)    # outputs: -3


Ex. 2
def subtra(a, b):
    print(a - b)

subtra(a=5, b=2)    # outputs: 3
subtra(b=2, a=5)    # outputs: 3

Ex. 3
def subtra(a, b):
    print(a - b)

subtra(5, b=2)    # outputs: 3
subtra(5, 2)    # outputs: 3


It's important to remember that positional arguments mustn't follow keyword arguments. That's why if you try to run the following snippet:

def subtra(a, b):
    print(a - b)

subtra(5, b=2)    # outputs: 3
subtra(a=5, 2)    # Syntax Error

Python will not let you do it by signalling a SyntaxError.




3. You can use the keyword argument passing technique to pre-define a value for a given argument:

def name(first_name, last_name="Smith"):
    print(first_name, last_name)

name("Andy")    # outputs: Andy Smith
name("Betty", "Johnson")    # outputs: Betty Johnson (the keyword argument replaced by "Johnson")




Exercise 1

What is the output of the following snippet?

def intro(a="James Bond", b="Bond"):
    print("My name is", b + ".", a + ".")

intro()


Check
My name is Bond. James Bond.

Exercise 2

What is the output of the following snippet?

def intro(a="James Bond", b="Bond"):
    print("My name is", b + ".", a + ".")

intro(b="Sean Connery")


Check
My name is Sean Connery. James Bond.

Exercise 3

What is the output of the following snippet?

def intro(a, b="Bond"):
    print("My name is", b + ".", a + ".")

intro("Susan")


Check
My name is Bond. Susan.

Exercise 4

What is the output of the following snippet?

def add_numbers(a, b=2, c):
    print(a + b + c)

add_numbers(a=1, c=3)


Check
SyntaxError - a non-default argument (c) follows a default argument (b=2)
