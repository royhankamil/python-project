Key takeaways

1. Computers store characters as numbers. There is more than one possible way of encoding characters, but only some of them gained worldwide popularity and are commonly used in IT: these are ASCII (used mainly to encode the Latin alphabet and some of its derivates) and UNICODE (able to encode virtually all alphabets being used by humans).


2. A number corresponding to a particular character is called a codepoint.


3. UNICODE uses different ways of encoding when it comes to storing the characters using files or computer memory: two of them are UCS-4 and UTF-8 (the latter is the most common as it wastes less memory space).
